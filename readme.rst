**BridgeFlow - Student-Teacher Application

This is a web-based application built for teachers and students, bridging the gap in their communication and ensuring a smooth flow in all their processes. 
It began as a personal project to showcase my learning journey with CI, but itâ€™s now evolving into something much more (I think).
